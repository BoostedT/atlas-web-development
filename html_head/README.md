# HTML Head Tag

In this project, I will be using the basics of HTML, focusing on the <head> tag and its importance in web development. By the end of the project, I  will have built a personal "get-to-know-me" site.

# About the <head> tag

The <head> tag is a crucial part of any HTML document. 

It contains metadata about the webpage and links to external resources that influence the page's structure, styling, and behavior.

# Why the <head> tag is important
